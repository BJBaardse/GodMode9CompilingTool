A little tool to compile GodMode9 or SafeMode9 and put it in a release like package.
firmtool is needed.
To use the tool extract the contents of GodMode9_compiling_tool.zip in a folder named like the commit you're using with the sourcecode inside.

The Zip made at the end has these things inside:

gm9
ntrboot
GodMode9.firm
HelloScript.gm9
readme.md

so as you see it is just like a release package.
